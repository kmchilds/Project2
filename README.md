# Project2
ELEN249 - AWGN Project
This project was created to learn the intricacies of a hardware gaussian noise generator as outlined in the paper "A Hardware Gaussian Noise Generator Using the Box-Muller Method and Its Error Analysis" written by Dong-U Lee et. al.
The implementation I used is by no means pretty or the most efficient possible execution of code, but it has taught me some of the hurdles that come with a hardware implementation of code.  I used Matlab to code this project after attempting to use System Generator without much luck, due to the hidden properties that caused difficulty in a simulation necessary before synthesis could be performed, thus, efforts moved to a more simplistic development through Matlab.  The code is thoroughly commented, so learning about each file should not be a problem.  In order to run this program, just execute the AWGN_TB.m file, which tests the AWGN.m file and its necessary function files.  Enjoy!!!  And if any part of this code is desired, feel free to use as you wish.
